    <p>A Smart Mobility & Management System for Elderly Care Facilities</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>i-gery</strong> is an elderly-care mobility and management system designed to reduce
        the physical workload of care workers and improve the daily experience of seniors living in
        long-term care facilities. The name comes from the “Geriatric Chair,” commonly used in nursing
        homes, which inspired our design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system was originally named <em>“Retirement Home Management System”</em>, but renamed to 
        <strong>i-gery</strong> to better reflect its focus on mobility, tracking, and smart workflow enhancement.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Background</h2>
    <p>
        Hong Kong faces rapid population aging. In many care homes, a small number of nurses must
        handle a large number of mobility-impaired seniors. Traditional geriatric chairs weigh 
        <strong>26–52 kg</strong>, making daily transportation extremely strenuous and leading to high
        rates of work-related injuries among caregivers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, many facilities lack an efficient way to track senior movement, activity
        routines, or caregiver workload, resulting in uneven task distribution and safety risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution Concept</h2>
    <p>
        i-gery includes two major components:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Assistive Mobility System</h3>
    <p>
        Instead of building an expensive motorized geri chair, we designed a 
        <strong>low-cost electric lift trolley</strong> that can raise and move existing chairs.
        This significantly reduces the physical strain on staff while keeping costs affordable for care homes.
    </p>

    <h3>2. QR Code Tracking & Management System</h3>
    <p>
        Every senior, caregiver, and room is assigned a QR code.  
        By scanning:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Senior ID</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Care worker ID</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        …the system uploads activity data to a central server, allowing staff to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track which caregiver assisted which senior</li>
        <li>Review daily activity distribution</li>
        <li>Identify workload imbalance</li>
        <li>Improve scheduling and incident response</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
        i-gery improves both safety and efficiency in elderly homes by reducing caregiver injuries,
        preventing neglect, and giving management a data-driven view of operations.
        The system enhances quality of care while encouraging more young individuals to join elderly services.
    </p>
